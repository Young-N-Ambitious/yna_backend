# Contributing to Young N Ambitious

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Young N Ambitious (YNA)! This
document is a set of guidelines to help you contribute to this project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Project Documentation

Please consult the [README](./README.md) at the root of this repository.

## How to Contribute

Before you start writing code, make sure there is an issue open. Pull requests
without a link to an existing issue won't be merged.

If you want to get started contributing code to this project but don't know
exactly what to work on, we compiled a good list of issues labeled as
['good first issues'](https://github.com/Young-N-Ambitious/yna_backend/labels/good%20first%20issue)
which are small in scope and not so complex to solve. There are also issues
labeled as
['help wanted'](https://github.com/Young-N-Ambitious/yna_backend/labels/help%20wanted)
which can be a bit more complex but are good examples of things we are currently
accepting help from the community. Lastly if you are participating in
Hacktoberfest, look for issues labeled
['hacktoberfest'](https://github.com/Young-N-Ambitious/yna_backend/labels/hacktoberfest).

# How To Contribute - Set Up

1. First you make a fork of the repo so that you can use your fork to update the
   project.
   1. After forking the repo in your local terminal:
      1. create a YNA directory by running `mkdir YNA`
      2. cd into the YNA directory by running `cd YNA`
      3. Clone the project to your local terminal by running git clone
         `git@github.com:{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/yna_backend.git`
      4. cd into the YNA backend directory by running `cd yna_backend`
      5. Now run `bundle install` to install all of the project dependencies.
   2. Now that you are inside the backend directory, you need to create a
      branch.
      1. To create a branch run: git checkout -b
         BA-[#<issue_number>]-<description/name>
         - **Example branch name: BA-001-enable-cors**
         1. The issue number can be found on the title of the issue you were
            assigned.
         2. The commit_types are:
            - (feat): (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build
              script)
            - (fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
            - (docs): (changes to the documentation)
            - (style): (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code
              change)
            - (refactor): (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
            - (test): (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production
              code change)
            - (chore): (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
         3. The description/name is the name or title descripting the changes
            you made.
   3. Once your branch is created, feel free to make changes to the code.

### How To Contribute - Pull requests

1. After adding your code you will need to add and commit your changes.
   1. Run `git status` - to see the files you changed and confirm thats what you
      want.
   2. Run `git add .` to add all of the files or `git add <file name>` to add a
      specific file.
   3. Once you know and added what files you want to commit. Commit your changes
      by running `git commit -m "BA-[#<issue_number>]<commit_type>:description"`
   4. Push your changes to your forked repo by running
      `git push --set-upstream origin <branch name>`
2. On Github create a pull request, all pull requests _must_ target the
   `development` branch of the repository.

Any code modifications will have to be accompanied by the appropriate unit
tests. This will be checked and verified during code review. Once the pull
request is opened, our CI server will run the unit test suite and run a code
linter to verify that the code follows the coding guidelines.

If you want to run the unit tests and linter on your machine, run the following
commands:

`npm test` for unit tests

You can also configure your editor of choice with a ESLint plugin so you can get
the linter feedback as you write code.

### Bugs and testing

If you find a bug, please open an issue in this repository describing the bug.
You can file a bug
[here](https://github.com/Young-N-Ambitious/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
You will see a bug report template with the required information you should
provide.

### Proposing changes or new features

If you have an idea of a new feature or change to how the Openverse backend
works, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/Young-N-Ambitious/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
so we can discuss the possibility of that change or new feature being
implemented and released in the future. This lets us come to an agreement about
the proposed idea before any work is done.
